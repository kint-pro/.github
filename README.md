# Kint

**Solving complex decisions â€“ with just natural language.**

---

**Kint** is a next-generation assistant for mathematical optimization.  
It enables teams, businesses and individuals to describe real-world problems in plain English â€“ and receive optimal solutions in seconds.

No equations. No code. No barriers.

### ðŸš€ What we do

Every day, companies face complex decisions:

- How to allocate machines, people, or resources?
- How to optimize supply chains and reduce costs?
- How to plan operations under uncertainty?

These are mathematical optimization problems.  
But traditional tools are hard to use, slow, and require expert knowledge.

**We change that.**  
Kint turns your natural language input into a precise optimization model, solves it instantly â€“ and gives you clear, explainable results.

### ðŸ’¡ How it works (from a user's perspective)

1. **Describe your problem** â€“ just like you'd explain it to a colleague  
2. **Our assistant understands** â€“ it analyzes, models and solves it automatically  
3. **You get results** â€“ optimal decisions, visualized and ready to use  
4. **You stay in control** â€“ review, adjust or iterate anytime

### ðŸŽ¯ Who it's for

- Logistics & operations managers  
- Planners & strategists  
- Product teams & analysts  
- Anyone who needs better decisions â€“ without writing code

---

### ðŸ§  Why it matters

Millions of decisions are made every day without optimization â€“ simply because the tools are too complex.

We believe:
> Optimization should be accessible. Understandable. Instant.

That's what Kint delivers.
